Machine Learning algorithm for predicting Slay the Spire run victory

Currently still a work in progress.  The code is all included and will not be changed greatly.  The rough draft of the paper is finished and can be found in word format.  In order to run locally you must manually unzip the X.zip file located in the Data folder.

To do list:

.Remove debugging lines of code

.Add additional code comments

.Proof read paper --DONE--

.Transcribe paper to LaTeX  --DONE--

.Make paper look nice --DONE?-- (Might work on this more)


Full player data not included until permission gained from MegaCrit

How to run code:
Download repository, unzip the X.zip file (should stay in the Data folder).  Once unzipped all code should run normally.
NOTE: All models are run in Python 2.7 except for XGBoost which requires Python 3
